# Super Practica

## Overview

[Super Practica](https://superpractica.org) is a revolutionary game designed to optimize building expertise in mathematics. It is free and open-source software built with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

It's kind of hard to explain though. The [Blueprint](https://codeberg.org/superpractica/blueprint) gives an outline of its theory and design.

Note that this game is incomplete and many changes are planned. At this stage it's not recommended to play except as a taste of what's to come.
