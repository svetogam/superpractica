# Super Practica

## Overview

[Super Practica](https://superpractica.org) is a revolutionary game designed to optimize building expertise in mathematics. It is free and open-source software built with [Godot](https://godotengine.org/).

It's kind of hard to explain though. The [Blueprint](https://codeberg.org/superpractica/blueprint) gives an outline of its theory and design.

Note that this game is incomplete and that major changes and additions are planned.


## How to play the game

* [On the website](https://superpractica.org/play)
* [On Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/superpractica/superpractica/releases)


## How to edit the game

1. Download the source code to get the Godot project folder.

2. Download [Godot Engine v4.4.1](https://godotengine.org/download/archive/4.4.1-stable/). (Some versions will be compatible and some won't be.)

3. Open the project folder in Godot.

The game should be playable and editable in Godot. Please open an issue if you followed the instructions and it's not working.
