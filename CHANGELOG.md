# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

This changelog is written for players rather than for developers. Greater version increases indicate completion of major new content, features, and aesthetic theming. Smaller version increases indicate other improvements and partial completion.

Content may stick around or be prepared in "debug levels" but will be considered as removed here.
